# MultiGranDTI
This repository is dedicated for releasing the implementation of the models utilized in the paper named MultiGranDTI: an explainable framework for drug-target interaction prediction integrating multi-granularity information.

Unfortunately, I'm still on the way of polishing my code for making it public.

Please stay tuned for update!

Thank you.
